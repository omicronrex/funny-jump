  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------

  A modern PC (Pentium 3 or higher) running Windows XP,
  NT5 or 2000 is required. After installation the
  program uses about 7000 KB disk space. The program
  prefers 4 million colors (true color, 32-bit).
  It requires at least 800x608 screen resolution.
  DirectX 8 or higher is required (not included).

  PATCH NOTES
  -----------
  
  The game shipped in a rather unfinished state due to my exhaustion,
  so here's a small update to fix a few problems and add a few things
  that were suggested to me after its release:
  
        - the music was recompressed, greatly reducing filesize
        - fixed a memory leak that caused a crash after a few hundred deaths
        - fixed an invincibility bug
        - the game no longer always plays Keisha first
        - fixed some text turning yellow on occasion
        - implemented some limits for save placement
        - fixed saves sometimes showing up on the wrong place
        - it's no longer possible to reset during level generation
