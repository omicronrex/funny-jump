  PATCH NOTES
  -----------
  
  The game shipped in a rather unfinished state due to my exhaustion,
  so here's a small update to fix a few problems and add some things
  that were suggested to me after its release:
  
        - added the ability to load and save screens, so you can share them
        - the music was recompressed, greatly reducing filesize
        - fixed a memory leak that caused a crash after a few hundred deaths
        - fixed an invincibility bug
        - small optimizations have been found
        - the game no longer always plays Keisha first
        - fixed some text turning yellow on occasion
        - implemented some limits for save placement
        - fixed saves being placed incorrectly sometimes
        - it's no longer possible to reset or die during level generation
        - added a new music track, Wonderfull also by Sidewinder
